My second project in the JS bootcamp.

The Recipe Library App is a web app that helps users find recipes based on different filters and sorting options. It pulls real recipe data from the Spoonacular API and dynamically updates the display as users make selections. The app includes a random recipe option, messages when no results are found and a fully responsive design. To improve performance and user experience, I added features like multi-filter functionality, local storage caching, a loading state and interactive recipe instructions.
